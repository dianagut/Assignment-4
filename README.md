# Assignment 4 - DVD Rent Store
A local movie rental store wishes to automate their inventory tracking system. Currently there are
three types of movies/videos (in DVD media) to be tracked:
* Comedy (denoted as ‘F’ for funny)
* Drama (denoted as ‘D’)
* Classics (denoted as ‘C’)

Borrows and returns of items by customers are also to be tracked. Four types of actions are
desired in the system:
* Borrow (denoted as ‘B’): (stock – 1) for each item borrowed
* Return (denoted as ‘R’): (stock + 1) for each item returned
* Inventory (denoted as ‘I’): outputs the inventory of all the items in the store
* History (denoted as ‘H’): outputs all the transactions of a customer
